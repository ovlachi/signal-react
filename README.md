This is a custom Webpack React project (not Create React App (In Progress) built completly in ReactJS and NextJS. 

It covers all aspects and features of how to create a modern React based Frontend application built with reusable components. Athentication is handled with MongoDB.

For state I have used useReducer and Context and for state immutability I have used Immer.

This project is in Progress so more updates will follow....
