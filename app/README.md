This is a (In Progress) web application built completly in React.JS and Next.JS.

It covers all aspects and features of how to create a modern React based Frontend application built with reusable components. Athentication is handled with MongoDB.

For state I have used useReducer and Context and for state immutability I have used Immer.

This project is in Progress so more updates will follow....
